It's even tougher when you fall victim to these hard truths.</p> </span> <span> Zave Smith/Getty Images </span> <p> Why is it so hard to <span> lose weight </span> ? It's a question many people have asked themselves, over and over. Aside from the obvious reasons -- food is delicious, <span> exercise </span>  is hard and <span> time is short </span> -- there are many other factors that affect <span> weight loss </span> and that many people don't even know they fall victim to. These six mistakes can definitely hinder your <span> weight loss </span> progress, but if you go into 2021 aware of them, you'll avoid common weight loss pitfalls.</p> <p> <strong> Read more:</strong>  <span> 6 things you absolutely don't need to get fit or healthy in 2021 </span> </p> <h3> <span> More on weight loss and health</span> </h3> Noom vs. Weight Watchers: Cost and more compared Intermittent fasting: How it can help you lose weight and even save money Eat more, weigh less: These low-calorie foods will fill you up at every meal Want to lose belly fat? Stop with the crunches and change your diet instead <h2> You have a short-term attitude</h2> <p> Everything on this list is somewhat of a hard truth, but this is often the hardest to accept (and change). If you approach weight loss with a short-term attitude, you may not make it anywhere except on the yo-yo diet train. </p> <p> Without a long-term approach to weight loss, you may lose 10 or more pounds in two weeks and then suffer a rebound when you discover that regimen wasn't working for you. This is all too common when people embark on strict diets such as keto or <span> paleo </span> , or <span> fad diets </span> that promise rapid weight loss. In reality, for most people, a well-balanced diet that includes <span> all food groups </span> and even some treats works best in the long run. </p> <p> Part of successful, sustainable weight loss -- i.e. losing the weight and keeping it off for good -- is understanding that fad diets, excessive exercise and "detoxes" don't usually work. They only last as long as your willpower lasts, and I'm willing to bet that's not more than two weeks to a couple of months. </p> CNET Health and Wellness <p> Our Health &amp; Wellness newsletter puts the best products, updates and advice in your inbox.</p> <p> There are no quick fixes, miracle cures or magic pills when it comes to weight loss, despite what the wellness industry might have you believe: Losing weight requires dedication to a plan that supports long-term healthy habits. </p> <p> The general recommendation for weight loss is a rate of one to two pounds per week, although initial weight loss might surpass that for people who are very overweight, and then slow down to the suggested one to two pounds per week. Studies have shown this to be an effective way to lose weight without losing too much water or lean tissue -- and to avoid a rebound . </p> <p> <strong> Read more:</strong> <span> The best adjustable dumbbells for 2021 </span> </p> <h2> The most important health tech of CES 2021</h2> <span> See all photos</span> <span> +5 More</span> <h2> You have an all-or-nothing mindset</h2> <span> </span> <span> <p> Overcoming an all-or-nothing mindset promotes long-term weight loss.</p> </span> <span> Malte Mueller/Getty Images. </span> <p> Many people who struggle with a short-term attitude also struggle with an all-or-nothing mindset. I myself began my health and fitness journey with this mindset. I cut out all (literally all!) <span> processed foods </span> : no <span> bread </span> , no pasta, no milk, no <span> cheese </span> , definitely no individually wrapped snacks. I basically existed on chicken, vegetables and <span> berries </span> . </p> <p> This was great until it wasn't, and I ended up on a CVS run for all the chocolate and Goldfish I could hold in two hands. Then, because I'd "ruined" my diet, I would eat as much as I could physically handle, because, "Why not? I already ruined it." </p> <p> Then, of course, I'd feel bad about the snacks I ate and return to my overly restrictive regimen the next day. This is a <span> destructive cycle </span> to be in, but it's something I see all the time with personal training clients. An all-or-nothing mindset can keep you in a perpetual cycle of lose-gain-lose, not to mention shame and guilt around food . </p> <p> This all-or-nothing concept applies to fitness, too: If you've been <span> The most effective workouts to get in shape in the least amount of time </span> left and right but don't feel fitter or stronger, you might be doing too much. Toning it down could -- counterintuitively -- be the answer to <span> improving your fitness </span> (and playing the long game). </p> <h2> You lack a support system</h2> <span> </span> <span> <p> A supportive community, IRL or online, can keep you motivated to lose weight and stay fit.</p> </span> <span> Thomas Barwick/Getty Images </span> <p> Supportive friends, family members and significant others are critical to successful weight loss. If I was asked to cite the most common reason for not sticking to a healthy diet from my past personal training clients, I would say stigma. </p> <p> That's right. As silly as it sounds, people really do get made fun of for eating healthy, especially in regions where food is an integral part of the culture. Growing up in southern Louisiana near New Orleans, I experienced this very often when I decided I was making changes to my diet.</p> <p> At family gatherings and social outings, I'd get comments like, "That's all you're eating?" or, "You're really not going to eat any dessert?" or, laden with sarcasm, "Next time we'll have a salad potluck."</p> <p> It's not fun to be ridiculed or scoffed at, especially for things you care about (like your health!), so it can be very easy to fall into a trap of eating -- and drinking -- for the sake of your social life. This is why a solid support system is key to long-term weight loss. Without it, the journey can feel lonely and intimidating. </p> <p> If you currently feel you lack a support system, try having open conversations with your friends, family and partner about it. You can make it clear that they don't have to change their eating habits if they don't want to, but that your health means a lot to you and you'd appreciate it if they didn't mock or downplay your hard work. </p> <p> If an IRL support system isn't working out, turn to online communities that promote both health and body positivity. I really love F lex and Flow on Instagram , Health At Every Size and the Intuitive Eating Community . These communities emphasize health without emphasizing weight, which is helpful because when you focus on the health outcomes, you'll reach your happy weight with ease. Reddit also has a great forum ( /r/loseit ) where you'll find lots of real-life stories about weight loss. </p> <h2> You think exercise conquers all</h2> <span> </span> <span> <p> Exercise is important for an overall healthy lifestyle, but it's hard to lose weight from exercise alone.</p> </span> <span> Tetra Images/Getty Images </span> <p> If you're at all attuned to the wellness industry, you'll know this saying: " Abs are made in the kitchen, not the gym ." Even if your goals don't include a shredded stomach, the adage is still relevant. You just can't out-exercise a poor diet. </p> <p> Exercise should definitely be part of your overall approach to weight loss because it's proven to aid weight loss (not to mention its long list of <span> other health benefits </span> ), but it's difficult to lose weight from exercise alone. Many people overestimate the number of calories they can burn from their workouts -- it's probably a lot less than you think. </p> <p> For example, a 154-pound man will burn less than 450 calories during an intense, hour-long weight lifting workout. You can easily cancel that effort out if you don't pay any attention to your diet. The exact number of calories you burn during exercise depends on many factors, including your current weight, the intensity of the activity, the length of the workout, your age and your <span> body composition </span> .</p> <p> Plus, focusing on only exercise can lead to a destructive cycle of exercising extra to burn off calories you feel you shouldn't have eaten. Or you may end up feeling like you need to "earn" your calories through exercise. Either way, taking this approach can lead to a strained relationship with food and exercise, as well as stalled weight loss. </p> <p> There are exceptions to all rules. Some people, such as those who have spent years putting on <span> muscle </span> mass, can eat lots of calorie-dense food and not gain weight -- but even if you can eat whatever you want and lose or maintain your weight, that doesn't mean it's healthy for you. </p> <p> A diet rich in fruit, vegetables, healthy fats, lean proteins and some whole grains will serve you best in terms of sustainable weight loss and health. Combined with a <span> consistent exercise routine </span> , you'll experience sustained weight loss and weight maintenance once you reach your goal weight.</p> <h2> Your sleep, stress and workload are working against you</h2> <span> </span> <span> <p> Chronic stress and sleep deprivation can hinder weight loss progress.</p> </span> <span> d3sign/Getty Images </span> <p> Losing weight will be a helluva lot harder if you're chronically stressed , <span> sleep-deprived </span> or overworked . This scenario may sound familiar to you: </p> You <span> wake up motivated </span> and ready to seize the day. You have plans for a post-work <span> interval run </span> and your healthy, prepped dinner is waiting in the fridge for you. A few hours into the day, your lack of sleep catches up with you. You reach for the afternoon <span> coffee </span> .  By the time work is over, you're way too drained to go for that run. You decide to skip it.  You're tired and maybe a little stressed or moody, so you nix the healthy dinner and hit a drive-through instead -- because comfort food. <p> This is OK if it happens occasionally (everyone deserves a lazy evening every once in a while), but weight loss will seem impossible if this happens all the time.</p> <p> The truth is, nutrition and exercise are <span> only two components of a healthy life </span> that can lead to weight loss. While important, too strong of a focus on nutrition and exercise can cause you to overlook other factors that are just as important: <span> sleep </span> and stress management. </p> <h2> You use supplements instead of eating a healthy diet</h2> <span> </span> <span> <p> Supplements don't work unless you do.</p> </span> <span> Basak Gurbuz Derman/Getty Images </span> <p> I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but that fat burner <span> supplement </span> in your medicine cabinet isn't going to do the work for you. While certain supplements may help you reach your weight loss goals, you have to work to make your supplements work. </p> <p> For example, incorporating a daily protein shake in the mornings can help you feel fuller throughout the day, which may help keep cravings at bay. Increased protein intake can also help you build muscle , which aids in <span> body recomposition </span> . </p> <p> Certain weight-loss supplements do have some evidence backing them , but no supplements are proven like the method that no one wants to take: <span> eat fewer calories than you burn </span> . </p> <p> </p> <p> The information contained in this article is for educational and informational purposes only and is not intended as health or medical advice.
